# Hi there, I'm Japheth Kiprono Ratemo 👋

## Backend Engineer | Distributed Systems Enthusiast | Building Resilient Software

I'm a passionate software developer specializing in building scalable, fault-tolerant backend systems. I believe in understanding systems from the ground up – which is why I built my own RDBMS to truly grasp database internals and including other different projects.

### 🔭 What I'm Building

- **Microservices architectures** with Spring Boot and FastAPI
- **Event-driven systems** using Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication
- **Resilient applications** with backpressure handling and circuit breaker patterns
- **Containerized deployments** with Docker and CI/CD pipelines

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Languages & Frameworks:**
- Go (Gin) – Primary expertise
- Python (FastAPI) – Secondary focus
- C and Rust - approaching mastery


**Infrastructure & DevOps:**
- PostgreSQL | Docker | Apache Kafka
- GitHub Actions | CI/CD Pipelines

**Core Competencies:**
- Database internals (WAL, Buffer Pools, Transaction Management)
- Microservices architecture & Distributed systems
- Fault tolerance & Resilience patterns
- Testing & TDD practices

### 🚀 Featured Projects

**[Custom RDBMS Implementation](link-to-repo)**
Built a relational database from scratch to understand core internals:
- Implemented page-based storage with slot management
- Developed Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) for crash recovery
- Engineered transaction management with ACID compliance
- *Tech: Java, File I/O, Concurrency Control*

**[Smart Fitness & Wellness Platform](link-to-repo)**
Microservices-based wellness platform with production-grade resilience:
- Apache Kafka for event-driven architecture
- Docker containerization for consistent deployments
- Backpressure handling and circuit breakers
- PostgreSQL optimization for analytics
- *Tech: Spring Boot, FastAPI, Kafka, Docker, PostgreSQL*

### 📚 Currently Learning

- Advanced distributed systems patterns
- System design at scale
- Production debugging and observability

### 🌱 Beyond Code

When I'm not building systems, you'll find me:
- 🐄 Running my animal farm and exploring agricultural innovation
- 🪵 Practicing carpentry and furniture making
- 🤝 Connecting with diverse communities beyond tech

### 💡 Open to Opportunities

I'm actively seeking backend engineering roles where I can contribute to building reliable, scalable systems while continuing to grow alongside talented teams. Particularly interested in fintech, agritech, and healthtech sectors in Kenya and remote opportunities.

**Let's build something resilient together!**
