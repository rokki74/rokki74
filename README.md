👋 Hey there, I'm Japheth Kiprono Ratemo (@rokki74)

I'm a full-stack developer though 80% lenient on backend as I like interacting with how computers work in the backseen especially on the programming languages like C++, Java and python for modelling and having intuitions on machine learning. I prefer the former two as this aligns more with my passion and only use python to connect and model how I can implement systems instead, I might sometimes be forced to even learn integrating an llm to an application using python then go try implement the same in C++. This has made me learn and even disapprove my decisios often due to reduced abstractions and coding on the metal if I would say. Apart from doing research and quenching my curiosity I'm also currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Applied Computer Science and it's hard mixing them up but I love the challenge of doing real world stuff and studying. I already hold a Diploma in Computer Science, and I’m passionate about building clean, responsive applications—especially on the backend (where I feel most at home!).

🛠️ Tech I Work With

Languages & Frameworks: . ⚙️ C++, Java, Python, FastAPi, Node.js
                        . 🖥️ React.js, Flutter

Databases: 💾 Databases MySQL, MongoDB

AI/ML: 🤖 AI/ML Exploring LangChain, Langgraph and integrating AI into real-world apps

Others: C language and always up for learning more!

💡 Interests:

👀 Software & Web Development (especially backend-heavy projects)

💞️ Collaborating on projects built with Java, C++,Python, Node.js—or anything exciting maybe assembly someday!

🌍 Studying history, culture, and how war shapes global economies

📚 Novels, 🎧 Music, and 🌲 Forest bathing (yes, really)

⚡ Fun Fact

I've always been curious how computers work even from my junior high school, so I tend to prefer low level stuffs and also machine learning models. I therefore started programming and we've been inseparable since. 😄
